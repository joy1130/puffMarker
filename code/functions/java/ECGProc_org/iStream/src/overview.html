This document is API specification for the <i>m-</i>Stream framework.
<p/>
<i>m-</i>Stream framework has been designed to streamline processing of time-series data. 
The general framework permits easy manipulation of time-series data using various operators and streams
implemented for the purpose. This framework can be easily deployed in any device running Android OS where
processing of sensor data is to be done. In addition, we provide packages for health-sensor data like ECG and EDA.

<h3>ECG processing </h3>
<p> The {@link org.mstream.stream.ecg} package provides classes for processing ECG data like noise-removal via smoothing, peak detection and
feature extraction.

<h3>EDA processing</h3>
<p> The {@link org.mstream.stream.eda} package provides classes for processing of EDA data.

<h3>General Streaming framework</h3>
<p> {@link org.mstream.stream}: This is the critical package consisting of interfaces and classes needed for this framework. This package
supports i) top-down streaming where streams at top receive data from lower streams on-demand, 
and ii) bottom-up or event-driven streaming (subscriber-producer model) where lower producer streams report data arrival to higer
subscriber stream.
