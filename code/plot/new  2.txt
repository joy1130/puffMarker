Data Structure for the matlab file (.mat):

Accessing sensor data:
----------------------

samples from sensor indicated by 'id': C.sensor{id}.sample

Unix timestamp (corresponding to each sample): C.sensor{id}.timestamp

Matlab Time (corresponding to each sample): C.sensor{id}.matlabtime


'id' for each sensor:
---------------------
Respiration: id = 1

Wrist (Left) Accelerometer x-axis, y-axis, z-axis: id = 27, 28, 29
Wrist (Left) Gyroscope x-axis, y-axis, z-axis: id = 30, 31, 32

Wrist (Right) Accelerometer x-axis, y-axis, z-axis: id = 33, 34, 35
Wrist (Right) Gyroscope x-axis, y-axis, z-axis: id = 36, 37, 38


Peak valley for each cycle of the respiration signal:
----------------------------------------------------
Amplitude: C.sensor{1}.peakvalley.sample 
(odd indices in 'sample' contain amplitude of valley, even indices contain that of peak)

timestamp: C.sensor{1}.peakvalley.timestamp 
(corresponding timestamps of valley and peak locations)


Puff marking in controlled environment:
---------------------------------------
Start of the smoking episode: C.smoking_episode.stattimestamp
End of the smoking episode: C.smoking_episode.endimestamp
Timestamp of left hand up: C.smoking_episode.timestamp_handL(1, 3, ...)
Timestamp of left hand down: C.smoking_episode.timestamp_handL(2, 4, ...)
Timestamp of right hand up: C.smoking_episode.timestamp_handR(1, 3, ...)
Timestamp of right hand down: C.smoking_episode.timestamp_handR(2, 4, ...)
Valley of the respiration cycle (index of peak valley array) for smoking puff: C.smoking_episode.puff.ind_rip_valley
